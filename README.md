# Project Overview:
In this project, we redesigned Etsy.com's UI and theme to improve spacing, enhance visual elements, and simplify content presentation, creating an elegant and user-friendly experience.
# Changes Implemented:
Overall Design
Increased Spacing: We increased the overall spacing throughout the website, which was previously compact, to create a more open and breathable layout.
Footer
Color Change: The footer's color has been changed from blue to a sophisticated grey (#17192359).
Enhanced Spacing: Increased space in the footer area gives it an elegant and modern look.
Tile Size: Each product tile has been slightly increased in both height and width.
Hover Effect: When hovered over, the product tiles now pop out or zoom in, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience.

# What is Etsy? Content Block
Simplified Content Block: The previous scroll-in animation, which split the information into three pages, has been converted into a single content block. This change offers a straightforward and simplistic presentation of the information.

# Home Page - Shop Our Popular Gift Categories
Hover Functionality: Enhanced hover functionality now displays a brief detail about the product. Previously, only the image and its category were shown, with details available only after clicking the image.
